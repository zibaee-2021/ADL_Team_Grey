If you haven't already installed git, apparently for MacOs, you simply have to run version command for first time:

Install git on MacOS:
> git --version


If you haven't already configured git on your laptop (your email address needs to be the primary email address you have associated with your github account):

If you're not sure which email address that is, check in your Github account Settings:
It's in the Settings (there are 2 different settings) which is in the list that comes up when you click on your github profile image (profile image is sometimes in the top right-hand corner). It's near the bottom of the list.
In Settings list (left-hand side) Emails is the 7th option. Click this to see which emails are associated with your account, and the primary one is at the top.

Configure:
> git config --global user.name "your name"
> git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"


You have option of using ssh or https (ssh is preferable but either works):

For ssh:

to generate ssh key (the email address needs to the primary email address you have associated with your github account)
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@example.com"

add key to ssh agent
> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

print ssh key so you can copy it
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

copy-paste this ssh key to your own github account:
you need to copy-paste your ssh (once created if not already have one) to your own github account (use output of the cat command below)

It's in the settings that are listed which are at bottom of list that comes up when you click on your github profile image (profile image is sometimes in the top right-hand corner).
In Settings, go to SSH and GPG keys in list (on left-hand side), click on 'New SSH Key' green button, then paste your key there.
