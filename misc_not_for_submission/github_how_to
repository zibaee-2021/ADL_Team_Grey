If you haven't already installed git, apparently for MacOs, you simply have to run --version command for first time:
The following are all terminal commands:


INSTALL ------------------------------------
Install git on MacOS:
> git --version

CONFIGURE ------------------------------------
If you haven't already configured git on your laptop (your email address needs to be the primary email address you have associated with your github account):

If you're not sure which email address that is, check in your Github account Settings:
It's in the Settings (there are 2 different settings) which is in the list that comes up when you click on your github profile image (profile image is sometimes in the top right-hand corner). It's near the bottom of the list.
In Settings list (left-hand side) Emails is the 7th option. Click this to see which emails are associated with your account, and the primary one is at the top.

> git config --global user.name "your name"
> git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"


GIT CLONE ------------------------------------
You have option of using ssh or https (ssh is preferable but either works):

For ssh:

to generate ssh key (the email address needs to the primary email address you have associated with your github account)
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@example.com"

add key to ssh agent
> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

print ssh key so you can copy it
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

copy-paste this ssh key to your own github account:
you need to copy-paste your ssh (once created if not already have one) to your own github account (use output of the cat command below)

It's in the settings that are listed which are at bottom of list that comes up when you click on your github profile image (profile image is sometimes in the top right-hand corner).
In Settings, go to SSH and GPG keys in list (on left-hand side), click on 'New SSH Key' green button, then paste your key there.

If not already, cd to folder into which you want to clone the repo

for SSH:
> git clone git@github.com:zibaee-2021/ADL_Team_Grey.git

or for HTTPS:
> git clone https://github.com/zibaee-2021/ADL_Team_Grey.git

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(If not already, cd to folder ADL_Team_Grey)

Once cloned, move the python file(s) that you have written, into the `src` subfolder (making sure the file name(s) is/are different from any existing ones).

And add it to the "staging area":

> git add [filename]

> git commit -m "your commit message describing what you have changed"

Now to push it to the remote repository (i.e. on Github) so that others can see it and if they want they can then pull a copy to their own machines.

> git push

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before starting your coding session, it's typically a good idea to always start off by pulling the remote repo to get all the latest changes that might have been
pushed by others in the team.

> git pull

Then it is common to do regular git commits after each chunk of changes you do, ideally including all the changes that are relevant for some specific functionality
and to provide a descriptive message.
Over the course of a day you might do 2-10 commits, for example.
And 1 or 2 pushes.
